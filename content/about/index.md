My journey into the world of programming began when I was just a 9th grader. Ever since, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities it offers.

During my initial two years in college, I immersed myself in the exhilarating world of CTFs with TeamBi0s. This experience exposed me to the realms of Cybersecurity, particularly in areas like Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation. Driven by a deep curiosity for core computer technologies, I decided to take a step back from CTFs and have since been diving headfirst into the world of Software development.

I had the privilege of serving as a SDE intern at Deciml, where I contributed to app maintenance, developed new features using Flutter, and assisted in migrating cloud functions. My journey is a continuous exploration of new horizons and an unyielding passion for technology.
