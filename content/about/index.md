Hey there , I'm Nikhil . I was introduced to the programming world back when I was in the 9th grade and since it has never failed to amuse me. 

I'm an **Electrical and Computer Engineering** undergrad currently on my 3rd year with GPA of 9.08.

Having spent my first two years in the college playing CTFs with **TeamBi0s**  , I gained immense exposure to the CyberSec World especially in the fields of Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation.  

Feeling the urge to explore more into core computer technologies, I retired from CTFs and currently I'm getting my hands on developing the Web.
