My journey into the world of programming began when I was just a 9th grader. Ever since, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities it offers.

During my initial two years in college, I immersed myself in the world of ***CTFs with TeamBi0s***. This experience exposed me to the realms of Cybersecurity, particularly in areas like***Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation***. Driven by a deep curiosity for core computer technologies, I have been diving headfirst into the world of ***Software development*** for the past two years.

My journey is a continuous exploration of new horizons and an unyielding passion for technology.
